Alphasense coding challenge

Please run `npm install` in root folder. This will install dependecies for both server and client.
I am using the npm script to install dependencies. Please refer to package.json file for other commands.

Use `npm start` command to start the application.

ps: `yarn install` will not run the post-install script.
